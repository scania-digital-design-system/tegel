# Deprecated Angular wrapper

Our Angular wrapper package can no longer be built or maintained in a sustainable way. After evaluating potential workarounds, it became clear that continuing support would slow down progress for the majority of users who are already on modern versions of Angular or React.

### What this means
- We will no longer update the Angular wrapper package.
- The [Angular](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@scania/tegel-angular) package will remain published as-is for any projects that still rely on it.
- We will create a maintenance branch to preserve the final state of the Angular wrapper.
- The [Angular (17+)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@scania/tegel-angular-17) and [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@scania/tegel-react) wrapper packages will continue to be actively maintained and improved.

### Why we made this decision

We want to be transparent about the factors behind this change:

**Keeping pace with modern tooling**<br/>
The ecosystem is rapidly standardizing around TypeScript 5+. Continuing to support older TypeScript versions would hold back improvements for the entire community.

**Sustainable maintenance**<br/>
Older Angular versions require significant overhead, custom patches, divergent build processes, and manual workarounds. This creates unnecessary technical debt.

**Supporting an EOL framework version**<br/>
Angular 17 and prior versions are no longer receiving security patches, bug fixes, or official support from the Angular team. Prioritizing actively supported versions.

# Using Tegel in Angular

Tegel offers Angular wrappers for all web components. While the rendered components still maintain their core as web components, these wrappers significantly enhance the developer's experience by providing a more intuitive API and seamless integration with Angular. You can find these wrappers in a separate package called `@scania/tegel-angular`, which is the recommended approach for integrating Tegel into a Angular application.

## Prerequisites

- Node version 18+
- Angular 14+

## Installing `@scania/tegel-angular`

Install the `@scania/tegel-angular` package via npm.

```bash
npm install @scania/tegel-angular
```

In your global css file import the tegel stylesheet.

```css
@import url('@scania/tegel/dist/tegel/tegel.css');
```

Import the `TegelModule` in your app.module.ts.

```typescript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
import { TegelModule } from '@scania/tegel-angular';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent, TesterComponent],
  imports: [BrowserModule, TegelModule],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

After this, all TDS components will be available in your template files. Example:

```html
<tds-button text="Click me!" variant="primary" size="sm">
  <tds-icon slot="icon" name="truck"> </tds-icon>
</tds-button>
```
