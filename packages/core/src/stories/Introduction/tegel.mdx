## Status

This package is in **production** and ready for use. It's available via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@scania/tegel) and can be installed using the installation guide which you can find [here](?path=/docs/getting-started-javascript--docs).

## @scania/tegel 🧱

**TLDR;** The new @scania/tegel package is an improvement and continuation of the previous @scania/components, @scania/theme-light, and @scania/icons packages. It simplifies the installation process and ships with type definitions, providing type safety and enhancing the developer experience through IntelliSense and autocompletion.

The new package includes all components as web components, removes the old CSS class components and makes the installation and updates easier. The current prefix for components, CSS variables, and utility classes - "sdds", will be changed. We have also created a new Storybook for @scania/tegel, which allows developers and designers to preview all variants of the components by changing the props.

## What is @scania/tegel? 🧱

In short, the new @scania/tegel package is an improvement and continuation of the previous @scania/components, @scania/theme-light and @scania/icons packages. These three packages have now instead been merged into one to simplify both the installation process, but also to make it easier for us to maintain and keep improving going forward.

The new @scania/tegel package ships with type definitions, enabling integration into other StencilJS projects and enhancing the developer experience through improved IntelliSense, autocompletion, and type safety. Additionally, as part of this update, we've upgraded StencilJS—the compiler used to build our components—to the latest major version.

We've saved the best for last—@scania/tegel is now 100% web components! Previous packages included a mix of web components and CSS class-based components, where utility classes were added to predefined HTML structures to achieve Tegel's look and feel. With this update, we've made a significant effort to deliver all components exclusively as web components, providing a more streamlined and consistent development experience.

## What improvements does @scania/tegel have? 🚀

So, what we are striving for in the new package is:

- Easy installation and updates
- A clear and intuitive API
- Types to be included in package bundle
- All input elements to work within a form
- Only web components
- Dark mode
- Improved interactive documentation - Storybook

With this new package we are creating a foundation for us to stand on going forward. We will keep improving and maintaining it after its initial release and with the changes we are introducing now we hope to be able to do this as smoothly as possible.

## Removing CSS class components ❌

With this new package we are also removing our CSS components and instead introducing web component counterparts to these. This means that every component that was available as a CSS component in @scania/components will have a web component alternative in @scania/tegel. This removal will be done in our next release of @scania/tegel. This change does not change the current @scania/components package.

## Prefix change 🔁

[Read more here](?path=/docs/migration-prefix-change--docs)

We are also working on a prefix change for our new package. Instead of "sdds" the components, CSS variables and utility classes will instead be prefixed with something else, for example:

- `<{prefix}-button />`
- `--{prefix}-button-color`
- `.{prefix}-u-flex`

This is done to have a clear distinction between what was @scania/components and what is @scania/tegel. What it also does is that it enables the two solutions to be installed alongside each other. This means that your migration can be done incrementally.

## Migration docs 📜

Migrations are always hard, but during the last couple of months we have put a lot of effort into creating a "migration document", which explains and highlights all the changes in our API from version 4 of @scania/components and @scania/tegel. We hope that this will ease your migration to our new package. The migration document is available [here](?path=/story/migration-from-components-v4--migration).

## Support for @scania/components 🤳

We will keep supporting @scania/components for a short while going forward, however we see no major updates being done to the package. This means we will keep answering and helping with support questions and do minor releases with bugfixes, but we are not introducing any new features.
