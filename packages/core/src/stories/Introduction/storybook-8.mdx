# Welcome to Storybook 8

For over two years, Storybook 6.5 has been an invaluable companion in supporting Tegel's technical documentation. We're thrilled to announce our upgrade to version 8.6, bringing you enhanced features and an improved user experience.

Our team is also looking forward to the upcoming [version 9](https://storybook.js.org/blog/storybook-9-beta/), which will introduce improved testing capabilities that we're eager to implement.

#### Key improvements in this version:

- A more spacious and visually appealing UI design
- Restructured documentation sections: Introduction, Getting Started, Migration, and System Setup
- Relocated Patterns section, now positioned after components
- Converted documentation-only stories to MDX format
- Added two new documentation sections: Framework Tips and Light-Dark Modes
- Canvas/Docs/Notes tabs are now organized under component folders in the side menu for improved navigation

Explore the visual examples below to better understand these changes:

### Enhanced User Interface

The new interface offers a more spacious layout and improved navigation experience, making it easier to find and work with components.

### Streamlined Navigation Menu

We've reorganized the documentation stories into distinct sections and added new content to help you get started quickly.
New stories for framework-specific tips and light/dark modes have been added. Note: The Icon story has been moved from foundation to components, while the icons gallery remains in its original location.

### Improved Component Organization

Components are now better organized with Canvas, Docs, and Notes conveniently located under the same component folder in the side menu.
In the previous version, these were located in the toolbar section.
