                            This package is currently in a <b>beta</b> stage. We are now working hard towards a 1.0 release,
                            but if
                            you
                            want to try out the package today you can! It's available via <tds-link><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@scania/tegel">NPM</a></tds-link> and can be installed using the
                            installation

                        <p>
                            <b>TLDR;</b> The new @scania/tegel package is an improvement and continuation of the previous
                            @scania/component,
                            @scania/theme-light, and @scania/icons packages. It simplifies the installation process and ships with types
                            which offers type safety and improves the developer experience with intellisence and autocompletion.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The new
                            package includes all components as web components, removes the old CSS class components and makes the
                            installation and updates easier. The current prefix for components, CSS variables, and utility classes -
                            "sdds",
                            will be changed. We have also created a new Storybook for @scania/tegel, which allows developers and
                            designers
                            to preview all variants of the components by changing the props.

                            What is @scania/tegel? üß±
                        </h4>




                        <p>
                            In short, the new @scania/tegel package is an improvement and continuation of the previous
                            @scania/component,
                            @scania/theme-light and @scania/icons packages. These three packages have now instead been merged into one
                            to
                            simplify both the installation process, but also to make it easier for us to maintain and keep improving
                            going
                            forward.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The new @scania/tegel is also shipped with types. This makes integrations in other Stenciljs
                            projects
                            possible, but also improves the developer experience with intellisence and autocompletion, and of course
                            type
                            safety. In this work we have also bumped the Stenciljs version (the compiler used to build our components)
                            to
                            the
                            latest major.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And we have saved the best for last, @scania/tegel is 100% web components. Previous packages
                            had
                            some
                            web components, but also CSS class components, these were utility classes that could be added to a predefined
                            HTML
                            structure to create the look and feel of Tegel. Now we are making a big effort to provide all components as
                            web components.

                        <p>
                            So, what we are striving for in the new package is:

                        <ul>
                            <li>Easy installation and updates</li>
                            <li>A clear and intuitive API</li>
                            <li>Types to be included in package bundle</li>
                            <li>All input elements to work within a form</li>
                            <li>Only web components</li>
                            <li>Dark mode</li>
                            <li>Improved interactive documentation - Storybook</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            With this new package we are creating a foundation for us to stand on going forward. We will keep improving
                            and
                            maintaining it after its initial release and with the changes we are introducing now we hope to be able to
                            do
                            this as
                            smoothly as possible.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            With this new package we are also removing our CSS components and instead introducing web component
                            counterparts to these. This means that every component that was available as a CSS component in
                            @scania/components will have a web component alternative in @scania/tegel. This removal will be done in our
                            next
                            release of @scania/tegel. This change does not change the current @scania/components package.

                        <p>
                            We are also working on a prefix change for our new package. Instead of "sdds" the components, CSS variables
                            and
                            utility classes will instead be prefixed with something else, for example:
                        <ul>
                            <li> <{prefix}-button /> </li>
                            <li> --{prefix}-button-color </li>
                            <li>.{prefix}-u-flex</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            This is done to have a clear distinction between what was @scania/components and what is @scania/tegel. What
                            it
                            also
                            does is that it enables the two solutions to be installed alongside each other. This means that your
                            migration
                            can
                            be

                            Migrations are always hard, but during the last couple of months we have put a lot of effort into creating a
                            "migration document", which explains and highlights all the changes in our API from version 4 of
                            @scania/components
                            and @scania/tegel. We hope that this will ease your migration to our new package. The migration document
                            will
                            continue to be updated until we release 1.0 and is available
