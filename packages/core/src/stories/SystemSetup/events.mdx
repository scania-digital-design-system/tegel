# Events Documentation 📝

The tegel components emit custom events to allow the users to respond to changes/updates in the components. These are all named using the tds-prefix.

For a click event this would result in the event being called `tdsClick`. To listen for these events in vanilla JS:

```js
document.addEventListener('tdsClick', (event) => {
  // Do something with/based on the event.
});
```

In React, you can listen to events by adding an event listener to the element:

```jsx
<tds-textfield
  ref={(element) =>
    element.addEventListener('tdsClick', (event) => {
      // Do something with/based on the event.
    })
  }
></tds-textfield>
```

In other JSX-environments, you can use the on-prefix:

```jsx
<tds-textfield
  onTdsChange={(event) => {
    // Do something with/based on the event.
  }}
></tds-textfield>
```

## Internal events

Some components use internal events prefixed with **internal**. These events are not recommended for use as they might change without notice.
