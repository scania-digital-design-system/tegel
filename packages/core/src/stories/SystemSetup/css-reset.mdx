# CSS Reset 🎨

While our web components look and work as intended out of the box, basic HTML elements like `html`, `p`, `h1`, etc, still need some CSS tweaks to work predictably across browsers.

For this reason we recommend the following minimal CSS reset. The included comments explain what each part is for.

Place the reset where you put your other global styles, before other styles are declared.

The CSS Reset is based on [Joshua Comeaus reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset).
For an in-depth explanation of each part we recommend reading the article on his website.

```css
/* BEGIN - CSS Reset */

/*
  Allow percentage-based heights in the application.
*/
html,
body {
  height: 100%;
}
/*
  Improve text rendering on MacOS.
*/
body {
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
}
/*
  Improve media defaults.
*/
img,
picture,
video,
canvas,
svg {
  display: block;
  width: 100%;
}
/*
  Remove built-in form typography styles.
*/
input,
button,
textarea,
select {
  font: inherit;
}
/*
  Prevent text from overflowing its container.
*/
p,
h1,
h2,
h3,
h4,
h5,
h6 {
  overflow-wrap: break-word;
}

/* END - CSS Reset */
```
