## Tegel Table

The Table component is designed to be a flexible and customizable table solution. It does not include built-in logic but instead relies on events and user-defined custom logic. On our demo pages, we have provided examples of how to implement basic logic for the Tegel Table.

### Highlights of Tegel Table:

- Part of the Tegel Design System, free to use.
- Simple UI components with custom events, props, and slots to accommodate different use cases and tech stacks within Scania.
- Sorting, multiselect, filtering, and pagination features with logic are presented on the demo pages.

### What do I need to install to use Tegel Table?

- As the Table component is included in the Tegel Design System, no extra installation is required.
- Check the "Installation" section in the side menu to get started.

This allows users to easily integrate Tegel Design System styling into AG-Grid by simply importing one CSS file.
