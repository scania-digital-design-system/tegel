# Prefix change üîÅ

Introduced in: ** @scania/tegel 0.0.9 **

In a previous announcement, we mentioned that @scania/tegel would undergo a prefix change. We have been diligently working on this for the past few weeks, and we are pleased to inform you that it is now complete. Previously, all components, utility classes, and CSS variables were prefixed with `sdds`. However, we have decided to introduce a different prefix for @scania/tegel, which will be `tds`. As a result, all our components, utility classes, and CSS variables will now be prefixed with `tds`, as shown below:

- `<tds-button/>`
- `--tds-button-color`
- `.tds-u-flex`

We have made this change to establish a clear distinction between @scania/components and @scania/tegel. Additionally, it will facilitate a smoother transition to the new package for you, the users. You can now install @scania/tegel alongside @scania/components, allowing for an incremental transition.
