# CSS Reset

While our web components look and work as intended out of the box, basic HTML elements like `html`, `p`, `h1`, etc, still need some CSS tweaks to work predictably across browsers.

For this reason we recommend a minimal CSS reset, the included comments explain what each part is for.

The CSS Reset is based on [Joshua Comeaus reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset). 
For an in-depth explanation of each part we recommend reading the article on his website.

Place the reset where you put your other global styles, before other styles are declared.

## The CSS Reset

```css
/*
  Use a more intuitive box-sizing model.
*/
*, *::before, *::after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
/*
  Remove default margin.
*/
* {
  margin: 0;
}
/*
  Allow percentage-based heights in the application.
*/
html, body {
  height: 100%;
}
/*
  Improve text rendering on MacOS.
*/
body {
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
}
/*
  Improve media defaults.
*/
img, picture, video, canvas, svg {
  display: block;
  max-width: 100%;
}
/*
  Remove built-in form typography styles.
*/
input, button, textarea, select {
  font: inherit;
}
/*
  Prevent text from overflowing its container.
*/
p, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
  overflow-wrap: break-word;
}
```
