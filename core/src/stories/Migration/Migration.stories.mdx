# Migration Docs

This document aims to include all the breaking changes when migrating from @scania/components version 4 to @scania/tegel.

## Deprecation of Native Components

In @scania/tegel, we have replaced all of our "native" components with their corresponding web component counterparts. As a result, every component previously available as a "native" component in @scania/components now has a web component equivalent in @scania/tegel. It's important to note that this change does not impact the existing @scania/components package.

## Event name convention

This change affects all components.

Previously we have not had a set naming convention for our events. This has led to misalignment between
components where some events has had a `custom` prefix, and others have had other ways of indicating whether
or not it is a custom event. We have now settled on a naming convention for all events.
Both **external**, events we expect you as a user to interact with, and **internal**, events that are used within
our components to update state/react to changes.

## Slot name convention

For @scania/tegel we have taken another look at the naming convention of our slot names. With this we discovered
a number on inconsistencies. To align on this we have now decided on a naming convention that goes for all of our
named slot.

The slot should always be named to represent its position/use case. This could for example be 'bottom', 'label' or
'suffix'.

These components have been updated:

- Accordion
- Button
- Card
- Checkbox
- Chip
- Dropdown
- Footer
- Header
- Message
- Modal
- Radio Button
- Side Menu
- Stepper
- Table
- Text Field
- Toast
- Toggle

#### What action is required?

Make sure all slots that are being used follow the convention.

## Prefix change

Furthermore we decided to rename the previously used 'sdds'-prefix to 'tds'.
This occurred as a result of a deliberate choice to facilitate the transition to the new Tegel package and prevent conflicts with previously used components.

In short, before the prefix change:

- Web component names are named with 'sdds-' + component name. ('sdds-badge')
- External events are named: 'sdds' + native event name. ('sddsClick', 'sddsChange')
- Internal events are named: 'internalsdds' + event name. ('internalsddsTablePropsChange', 'internalsddsCheckboxChange')

Now, after prefix change:

- Web component names are named with 'tds-' + component name ('tds-badge')
- External events are named: 'tds' + native event name. ('tdsClick', 'tdsChange')
- Internal events are named: 'internaltds' + event name. ('internaltdsTablePropsChange', 'internaltdsCheckboxChange')

You can read more about naming in our code conventions [here](https://github.com/scania-digital-design-system/tegel/blob/main/.github/CODE_STYLE.md).

## Removed base font-size and moved to `px` instead of `rem`.

This change affects all components/typography/spacing/grid.

In the past we have used a base value of 4px
that has been used to calculate the spacing/padding/margins etc with rem. This was done by setting the
base value (4px) as the font-size on the `<html>`-element, which for some users has caused error with
custom font-sizes. We have now removed these dependencies and are using pixels in our
components/spacing/typography/margins.

We are doing this to decrease the dependencies between our packages and we want to make sure the Tegel
can be used on its own.

#### What action is required?

If you are not currently utilizing `rem` in your project, this change ideally should not impact you directly. However, since it affects all components, utilities, and foundations, there is a possibility of encountering unforeseen issues. Resolving these problems will be our top priority to ensure a seamless transition to Tegel.

If you are however using `rem` in your project you would have to consider that the base value will no longer be `4px`.
This value will now by default be `16px`. So for the element in you project that are using rem these would have to be
recalculated.

## Dark mode and mode variants

We are introducing **dark mode** as an addition to our current **light mode**, as well as two mode variants — **primary** and **secondary** — to our codebase. This will require changes to the classes and properties used for styling components. It is important to note that the primary mode variant used to be referred to as "on-white" and the secondary mode variant as "on-grey-50" in light mode.

**Light mode primary** is designed for a **white** background, while **secondary** is designed for a **grey-50** background. Previously, **grey-50** was used as our primary color.

**Dark mode primary** is designed for a **grey-958** background, and **secondary** is designed for a **grey-900** background.

#### What action is required?

It is important to note that some components may have a different appearance due to these changes. The following components will now have a primary and secondary mode:

- Accordion
- Block
- Button
- Card
- Data-table
- Datetime
- Divider
- Dropdown
- Footer
- Message
- Tab
- Text Field
- Textarea

##### Changing mode

Mode is controlled on a top level, using class `tds-mode-dark` or `tds-mode-light` (light is default).

##### Changing mode variant

For all components, you can use the `mode-variant` prop to apply the mode variants, with `primary` or `secondary`
as valid input (primary is default). If no prop is given, the component is going to inherit the mode variant from its parent.

To switch between the different modes and mode variants, simply use the appropriate classes or properties in your code.

These changes are also planned for the UI kit in Figma.

## Accordion

[Story](/docs/components-accordion--default)

#### Replaced `affix` with `expand-icon-position`

The attribute `affix` was replaced by `expand-icon-position`, since `affix` is not descriptive enough of what it does.

##### What action is required?

Replace `affix="prefix"` with `expand-icon-position="start"` and remove `affix="suffix"`.

```jsx
// Old ❌
<sdds-accordion>
  <sdds-accordion-item header="Lorem ipsum" affix="prefix" tabindex="0">
    // ...
  </sdds-accordion-item>
</sdds-accordion>

// New ✅
<tds-accordion>
  <tds-accordion-item header="Lorem ipsum" expand-icon-position="start" tabindex="0">
    // ...
  </tds-accordion-item>
</tds-accordion>
```

#### Added prop for mode-variant and removed class `sdds-on-white-bg`

Previously the class `sdds-on-white-bg` was used to determine the mode variant. We have now introduced the prop `mode-variant`, which has the values `primary` or `secondary`, to determine the variant being displayed. For this component `primary` is the default value and represents the old `sdds-on-white-bg`

##### What action is required?

Replace all instances of `class="sdds-on-white-bg"` with the prop `mode-variant`.
If the component is used on a background with a color of grey-50, mode-variant prop value `secondary` should be passed.

```jsx
// Old ❌
<sdds-accordion class="sdds-on-white-bg">
  <sdds-accordion-item header="Lorem ipsum" tabindex="0">
    // ...
  </sdds-accordion-item>
</sdds-accordion>

// New ✅
<tds-accordion mode-variant="primary">
  <tds-accordion-item header="Lorem ipsum" tabindex="0">
    // ...
  </tds-accordion-item>
</tds-accordion>
```

## Badge

[Story](/docs/components-badge--default)

#### Component name updated to adhere to convention

The badge was previously named `sdds-badges`, to conform with our naming convention this has been changed to singular.

```jsx
// Old ❌
<sdds-badges></sdds-badges>

// New ✅
<tds-badge></tds-badge>
```

#### Replaced "isVisible" prop with "hidden"

The visibility of the Badge was previously determined by its `isVisible` prop. This has now been changed to a `hidden`
prop, to align with other components. This prop is `false` by default, so for visible badges it does not have to be set.

##### What action is required?

Replace all intances of `isVisible="false"` with `hidden`.

```jsx
// Old ❌
<sdds-badges value="1" is-visible="false" size="default"></sdds-badges>

// New ✅
<tds-badge value="1" hidden size="lg"></tds-badge>
```

#### Replaced "default" value of size prop with "lg", renamed to sdds-badge

As part of the standardization of size props, the default value "size" was replaced with "lg" to align with the "t-shirt" naming convention.

Renamed from "badges" to "badge" to conform with other components.

##### What action is required?

Replace size value `default` with `lg` or just remove prop as component's default size is `lg`.

Rename component.

```jsx
// Old ❌
<sdds-badges value="1" is-visible="true" size="default"></sdds-badges>

// New ✅
<tds-badge value="1" size="lg"></tds-badge>
```

## Button

[Story](/docs/components-button--default)

#### Changed prop `variant` to `mode-variant` in web component

We removed the `variant` prop and replaced it with a new prop, `mode-variant`. New available types are `primary`(prev. `variant`) and `secondary`(prev. `default`).

##### What action is required?

Rename `variant` to `mode-variant` and change type name.

```jsx
// Old ❌
<sdds-button variant="variant">
  Button text
</sdds-button>

// New ✅
<tds-button mode-variant="primary">
  Button text
</tds-button>
```

## Datetime

[Story](/docs/components-datetime--default)

#### Aligned props for ´label´ and 'helper'

Previously `<sdds-datetime>` component components has used slots for label and helper. This has now been
aligned with other components and this component now accepts two props `label` and `helper` to display
these texts.

##### What action is required?

Change all `<sdds-datetime>` that are using slots to use the prop instead.

```jsx
// Old ❌
<sdds-datetime id="datetime" type="datetime-local" size="lg" state="none" no-min-width>
  <label slot="sdds-label">Label text</label>
  <span slot="sdds-helper">Helper text</span>
</sdds-datetime>

// New ✅
<tds-datetime
  id="datetime"
  type="datetime-local"
  size="lg"
  state="none"
  no-min-width
  label="Label text"
  helper="Helper text"
></tds-datetime>
```

#### Renamed prop 'nominwidth' to 'no-min-width'

The prop `nominwidth` was changed to `no-min-width` to conform with other prop names.


##### What action is required?

Change all uses `nominwidth` to `no-min-width`.

```jsx
// Old ❌
<sdds-datetime type="datetime-local" nominwidth>
</sdds-datetime>

// New ✅
<tds-datetime type="datetime-local" no-min-width>
</tds-datetime>
```

## Dropdown

[Story](/docs/components-dropdown--default)

#### Refactored component

The Dropdown has been completely overhauled and redone. This leads to a number of props/events/etc changing names
and features. Please have a look at the component and do the updates that affect you.

##### What action is required?

Please have a look at the component and do the updates that affect you.

## Slider

[Story](/docs/components-slider--default)

#### Changed prop name 'scrubberSize'

The prop `scrubberSize` was changed to `thumbSize` to align with design.

##### What action is required?

Rename all instances of `scrubber-size` to `thumb-size`.

```jsx
// Old ❌
<sdds-slider scrubber-size="lg"></sdds-slider>

// New ✅
<tds-slider thumb-size="lg"></tds-slider>

```

## Tabs (Inline, Folder & Navigation)

### Updated `<sdds-inline-tabs>` and `<sdds-navigation-tabs>` and introduced `<sdds-folder-tabs>`. Introduced child components for all Tabs.

Previously we had the `<sdds-inline-tabs>` and `<sdds-inline-tabs-fullbleed>`. These had little resemblance to each other in appearance, thus it was more logical to consider them as completely distinct components.
In order to establish a clear differentiation between them, we have renamed `<sdds-inline-tabs>` to `<sdds-folder-tabs>` so as to better reflect its visual appearance.
Our three tabs (inline, folder, and navigation) are designed to function with both buttons and links. To achieve this, we have introduced a single child element for each tab, which is intended to wrap the underlying element.

```jsx
<tds-inline-tab></tds-inline-tab>
<tds-folder-tab></tds-folder-tab>
<tds-navigation-tab></tds-navigation-tab>
```

The component no longer manages the content displayed under each tab. Therefore, it is now up to you, as a component user to implement it yourself. We will provide examples of how this can be done, and if you have any questions, we are always here to assist you.

The new components are available here in storybook:

- [Inline Tabs](/docs/components--inline-tabs)
- [Folder Tabs](/docs/components--folder-tabs)
- [Navigation Tabs](/docs/components--navigation-tabs)

## Textarea

[Story](/docs/components--textarea)

#### Changed prop name 'max-length'

The prop `maxlength` was changed to `max-length` to conform with other prop names.

##### What action is required?

Rename all instances of `maxlength` to `max-length`.

```jsx
// Old ❌
<sdds-textarea
    maxlength="10"
></sdds-textarea>

// New ✅
<tds-textarea
    max-length="10"
></tds-textarea>

```

#### Changed prop name 'readonly'

The prop `readonly` was changed to `read-only` to conform with other prop names.

##### What action is required?

Rename all instances of `readonly` to `read-only`.

```jsx
// Old ❌
<sdds-textarea
    readonly
></sdds-textarea>

// New ✅
<tds-textarea
    read-only
></tds-textarea>

```

#### Added prop for mode-variant and removed class `sdds-on-white-bg` on container element

Previously the class `sdds-on-white-bg` was used to determine the mode variant. We have now introduced the prop `mode-variant` with values `primary` or
`secondary`. `primary` is the default value and represents the old `sdds-on-white-bg`

##### What action is required?

Replace all instances of `class="sdds-on-white-bg"` on container element with the prop `mode-variant` and pass `primary` as value directly on the component element.
If the component is used on a background with a color of grey-50, mode-variant prop value `secondary` should be passed.

```jsx
// Old ❌
<div class="sdds-on-white-bg">
  <sdds-textarea> </sdds-textarea>
</div>
// New ✅
 <tds-textarea mode-variant="primary">
 </tds-textarea>
```

## Text Field

[Story](/docs/components--textarea)

#### Changed component name to conform with convention.

The Text Field components was renamed to conform with american english convention.

##### What action is required?

Update all instaces of textfield to text-field.

```jsx
// Old ❌
<sdds-textfield
></sdds-textfield>

// New ✅
<tds-text-field
></tds-text-field>
```

#### Changed prop name 'maxlength'

The prop `maxlength` was changed to `max-length` to conform with other prop names.

##### What action is required?

Rename all instances of `maxlength` to `max-length`.

```jsx
// Old ❌
<sdds-textfield
    maxlength="10"
></sdds-textfield>

// New ✅
<tds-text-field
    max-length="10"
></tds-text-field>
```

#### Changed props for label and label-position to align with convention.

The prop `label-inside` was used to set an inside label, and to set an outside label you would pass a `<slot>`.
This has been changed and aligned with convention. This component now accepts a `label` prop for the text to
be displayed and a `label-position` to set the position of this label. For no label just leave out the `label`
and `label-position` props.

##### What action is required?

For all labels inside remove the `label-inside` prop and add `label-position="inside"` and `label="Your label text"`
props. For label outside remove the `<label slot="sdds-label">Label text</label>` and add `label-position="outside"`
and `label="Your label text"` props instead.

```jsx
// Old ❌ - Inside label
<sdds-textfield
  type="text"
  size="lg"
  state="none"
  variant="default"
  label-inside="Label text"
  placeholder="Placeholder">
</sdds-textfield>

// Old ❌ - Outside label
<sdds-textfield
  type="text"
  size="lg"
  state="none"
  variant="default"
  placeholder="Placeholder">
   <label slot="sdds-label">Label text</label>
</sdds-textfield>


// New ✅ - Inside label
<tds-text-field
  type="text"
  size="lg"
  state="none"
  variant="default"
  label="Label text"
  label-position="inside"
  placeholder="Placeholder"
></tds-text-field>

// New ✅ - Outside label
<tds-text-field
  type="text"
  size="lg"
  state="none"
  variant="default"
  label="Label text"
  label-position="outside"
  placeholder="Placeholder"
  ></tds-text-field>
```

#### Changed prop name 'nominwidth'

The prop `nominwidth` was changed to `no-min-width` to conform with other prop names.

##### What action is required?

Rename all instances of `nominwidth` to `no-min-width`.

```jsx
// Old ❌
<sdds-textfield
    nominwidth
></sdds-textfield>

// New ✅
<tds-text-field
    no-min-width
></tds-text-field>
```

#### Removed slot for helper and added `helper` prop

Previously the textfield has had its helper text set via a slot. This is now changed
to be a prop instead, to align with other components.

##### What action is required?

Change all instaces of `<span slot='sdds-helper'>${helper}</span>` to attrubute
`helper="${helper}"`

```jsx
// Old ❌
<sdds-textfield
>
  <span slot='sdds-helper'>Helper text!</span>
</sdds-textfield>

// New ✅
<tds-text-field
    helper="Helper text"
></tds-text-field>
```

#### Added prop for mode-variant and removed class `sdds-on-white-bg` on container element

Previously the class `sdds-on-white-bg` was used to determine the mode variant. We have now introduced the prop `mode-variant` with values `primary` or
`secondary`. `primary` is the default value and represents the old `sdds-on-white-bg`

##### What action is required?

Replace all instances of `class="sdds-on-white-bg"` on container element with the prop `mode-variant` with `primary` as value directly on the component.
If the component is used on a background with a color of grey-50, mode-variant prop value `secondary` should be passed.

```jsx
// Old ❌
<div class="sdds-on-white-bg">
  <sdds-textfield> </sdds-textfield>
</div>
// New ✅
 <tds-text-field mode-variant="primary">
 </tds-text-field>
```

## Table

[Story](/docs/components-table--basic)

#### Renamed `enablePagination`, `enableMultiselect` and `enableFilter` props to `pagination`, `multiselect` and `filter`.

##### What action is required?

```jsx
// Old ❌
<sdds-table enable-multiselect>
  <sdds-table-header enable-filter>
    //
  </sdds-table-header>
  <sdds-table-body enable-dummy-data>
    //
  </sdds-table-body>
  <sdds-table-footer enable-pagination></sdds-table-footer>
</sdds-table>

// New ✅
<tds-table multiselect>
  <tds-table-header filter>
    //
  </tds-table-header>
  <tds-table-body>
    //
  </tds-table-body>
  <tds-table-footer pagination ></tds-table-footer>
</tds-table>
```

#### Removed `disableFilteringFunction`, `disableSortingFunction` and `enableClientPagination`.

Previously, the Table component provided these props to enable users to implement their own filter, sort, and pagination logic. However, we have now removed these props and replaced them with cancellable events emitted by the component.

The events are: 'tdsPagination', 'tdsSort', 'tdsFilter'

##### What action is required?

```jsx
// Old ❌
<sdds-table >
  <sdds-table-header>
    //
  </sdds-table-header>
  <sdds-table-body enable-dummy-data>
    //
  </sdds-table-body>
  <sdds-table-footer pagination enable-client-pagination rows-per-page="4"></sdds-table-footer>
</sdds-table>

// New ✅
<tds-table >
  <tds-table-header>
    //
  </tds-table-header>
  <tds-table-body enable-dummy-data>
    //
  </tds-table-body>
  <tds-table-footer pagination rows-per-page="4"></tds-table-footer>
</tds-table>

<script>
  document.addEventListener('tdsPageChange', (event) => {
    event.preventDefault()
  })

</script>
```

#### Removed the `bodyData` prop.

Previously the Table could populate its rows/columns based on a bodyData property. This has now been removed due to performance reasons.

##### What action is required?

Instead of populating the Table via bodyData you as a user will have to render the rows/columns you want to display.
