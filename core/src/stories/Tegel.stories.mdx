# Tegel Design System

https://tegel.scania.com/

The design system supports the design and development of digital solutions at Scania. The purpose is to secure a coherent, premium brand and user experience across all of Scania's digital touchpoints.

## Status

This package is currently in a **pre-beta** stage. We are now working hard towards a 1.0-beta release, but if you want to try out the package today you can! It's available via NPM and can be installed using the installation guide below.


# @scania/tegel üß±

**TLDR** ;_The new @scania/tegel package is an improvement and continuation of the previous @scania/component, @scania/theme-light, and @scania/icons packages. It simplifies the installation process and ships with types which offers type safety and improves the developer experience with intellisence and autocompletion. The new package includes all components as web components, removes the old "native" components and makes the installation and updates easier. The current prefix for components, CSS variables, and utility classes - "sdds", will be changed. We have also created a new Storybook for @scania/tegel, which allows developers and designers to preview all variants of the components by changing the props._


## What is @scania/tegel? üß±

In short, the new @scania/tegel package is an improvement and continuation of the previous @scania/component, @scania/theme-light and @scania/icons packages. These three packages have now instead been merged into one to simplify both the installation process, but also to make it easier for us to maintain and keep improving going forward. The new @scania/tegel is also shipped with types. This makes integrations in other Stenciljs projects possible, but also improves the developer experience with intellisence and autocompletion, and of course type safety. In this work we have also bumped the Stenciljs version (the compiler used to build our components) to the latest major. And we have saved the best for last, @scania/tegel is 100% web component. Previous packages had some web components, but also "native" components, these were utility classes that could be added to a predefined HTML structure to create the look and feel of Tegel. Now we are making a big effort to provide all components as web components.

## What improvements does @scania/tegel have? üöÄ

So, what we are striving for in the new package is:

- Easy installation and updates
- A clear and intuitive API
- Types to be included in package bundle
- All input elements to work within a form
- Only web components
- Dark mode
- Improved interactive documentation - Storybook

With this new package we are creating a foundation for us to stand on going forward. We will keep improving and maintaining it after its initial release and with the changes we are introducing now we hope to be able to do this as smoothly as possible.

## Removing "native" components ‚ùå

With this new package we are also removing our "native" components and instead introducing web component counterparts to these. This means that every component that was available as a "native" component in @scania/components will have a web component alternative in @scania/tegel. This removal will be done in our next release of @scania/tegel. This change does not change the current @scania/components package.

## Prefix change üîÅ

Read more [here.](?path=/story/intro-announcements-prefix-change--page)

We are also working on a prefix change for our new package. Instead of "sdds" the components, CSS variables and utility classes will instead be prefixed with something else, for example:

- `<{prefix}-button/>`
- `--{prefix}-button-color`
- `.{prefix}-u-flex`

  This is done to have a clear distinction between what was @scania/components and what is @scania/tegel. What it also does is that it enables the two solutions to be installed alongside each other. This means that your migration can be done incrementally.

## Migration docs üìú

Migrations are always hard, but during the last couple of months we have put a lot of effort into creating a "migration document", which explains and highlights all the changes in our API from version 4 of @scania/components and @scania/tegel. We hope that this will ease your migration to our new package. The migration document will continue to be updated until we release 1.0 and is available [here.](https://tegel-storybook.netlify.app/?path=/story/intro-migrating-from-components%C2%A0v4--page)

## Support for @scania/components ü§≥

We will keep supporting @scania/components for a short while going forward, however we see no major updates being done to the package. This means we will keep answering and helping with support questions and do minor releases with bugfixes, but we are not introducing any new features.

## When can I try our @scania/tegel? üß™

Today! Some of you have already tried this package out, and provided us with valuable feedback, thank you! But please note that this package is still in beta and breaking changes are to be expected before we release 1.0. The package is available via npm and an installation guide is available [here.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@scania/tegel)
