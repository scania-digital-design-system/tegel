3. Run `npm install` in the root directory.
4. Run `npm install` in the `packages/core` directory.
5. Development version of Storybook with additional plugins and beta components can be activated by setting the environment variable `STORYBOOK_ENV` to `dev` in the same terminal where you run rest of the commands.

```
export STORYBOOK_ENV=dev
```

6. Make sure you are in the root directory, and start the dev server with `npm run start`.
 - *Alternatively navigate to `packages/core` and start the dev server with `npm run storybook`*
